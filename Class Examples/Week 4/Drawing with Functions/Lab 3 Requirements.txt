Requirements for Drawing
You can update your program from Lab 2, or create a new program.
This lab is worth 50 points. See the point breakdown below.

Incorporate the following items:

Find the folder for Lab 03 in PyCharm and start entering your code there. Feel free to use
 any code from Lab 02 you want, just copy it across.

Make sure you are putting your program in the Lab 3 folder, and not just changing Lab 2 to
have Lab 3 requirements.

We are going to be following the instructions/example in Drawing With Functions.

Put everything into a function as shown in Make The main Function.

Create three functions that draw something.

Define the function and successfully call it.

Make your drawing function complex. 0 points for a one-line function that just draws a
rectangle, 0 points for copying

the example from the book, 2 points for a cohesive multi-line function.

Pass in x and y parameters and successfully position the object as shown in
Make The Drawing Functions.

Make sure the image you draw is centered around the x and y, and not off-set.

Call at least one of the functions more than once, and in a different location.

Double Check
Make sure you donâ€™t put functions inside of functions. After the import statement, each
function should be listed out, one def after the other. But no def inside of another def.

Make sure you have three functions that take in an (x, y) position to draw an object,
 not just one.

The most frequent source of confusion on this lab, and way to lose points, is a drawing
function that is not centered around the specified (x, y). You can confirm this is working
by drawing a point right at the x, y as the last line of your code. If the point draws
near the center of your item, you are good. If the point is nowhere near the center,
you need to re-center it.
